## An app to navigate Dominican University of California

### Why it exists
Dominican University of California has a beautiful campus but navigating it can be a challenge. To remedy this I have developed a web app to help navigate it.

### How to use
1. run ```python3 main.py```

1. Enter the starting node number in the terminal

1. Enter the destination node number in the terminal (Note due to poor Open Street Maps data for Dominican some starting/destination node combos don't work)
